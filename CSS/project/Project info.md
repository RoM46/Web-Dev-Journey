# Project information
In this folder, you will find my CSS project where I recreated the motivational meme from the bootcamp.

## Project details:
This project was simply to create -or recreate- a motivational meme. I recreated the one provided as an example, but I will defo be creating my own ones for fun.

## Here's what went unlike expected (but not wrong):
- **external vs internal CSS**: while the template did contain a CSS stylesheet, I comlpetely missed it while working and ended up typing the whole CSS portion internally. I later redid it externally.
- **it took me a bit of time tackling the box model**: I am not unfamiliar to CSS, but it is my first time working so technically with it and actually learning to design and build something with it. It took me sometime to properly get the right properties, values and match them to the right elements. I had to do some research, but it is definitely coming about -better than knowing nothing at all. I decided to practice further however.
- **font not fonting!**: Although I can deal with fonts somewhat well for a beginner in CSS, I was quite surprised realising that it doesn't always show in the preview, but maybe the browswer. So, this is something I will keep not of

## Something new that I learned:
**text-transform**... This saves a lot of time, and cognitive load :) 
Basically, it helps you format your text all you like. Uppercase, lowercase, capitalise etc etc. 
Very convenient
