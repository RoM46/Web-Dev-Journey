In this folder, there are projects (introductory and intermediate) which I made at the beginning of the course to practce what I learned in the course
1. songRanking: in this project, I demonstrated how I can apply headings, horizontal rule (<hr/>) lists -particularly ordered lists- where I ranked and described songs I like
2. bdayInvite: in this project, I applied what learned in regards to attaching images (<img src=""/>), links(<a href=""></a>), and all what I learned previously
3. firstPortfolio: in this project, I had my first attempt at combining all the new skills I learned to create a "dummy" portfolio. Next step, after learning some CSS to jazz it up, 
I will have a nicer portfolio to show off
