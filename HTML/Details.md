# Details

This folder contains introductory and intermediate projects that I created at the beginning of the course to practice what I learned.

1. **songRanking**  
   In this project, I demonstrated how to use headings, horizontal rules (`<hr/>`), and ordered lists to rank and describe songs I like.

2. **bdayInvite**  
   This project showcases my understanding of how to attach images (`<img src=""/>`), create links (`<a href=""></a>`), and apply previously learned HTML concepts.

3. **firstPortfolio**  
   My first attempt at combining all the new skills I acquired to build a "dummy" portfolio. The next step is to learn some CSS to jazz it up and create a more polished portfolio to show off.

4. **AbdelHalim**  
   Although not an official project, this exercise helped me practice using anchors and referencing links in HTML. The original task was to list the top 5 websites, but I customized it to feature the top 5 Abdel Halim songsâ€”my favorite classical Egyptian artist.
